Welcome to Weihao Cao's personal website. My research interests focus on quantum computing and condensed matter physics, with personal interest in expanding potential interests multidisciplinary.   
You may refer to the [Resume](resume/) page or [Detail Info](https://cwhypt.wixsite.com/main) for my profile or multimedia. On the [Timeline](timeline/) page are some  messy experiences. What's more, the [Blog](blog/) page is used to record some sturctured knowledge.(Welcome for discussion!)   
Finally, if you have any issues, contact me through the [Contact](contact/) page or email me directly.
