##  Equation of Motion  
   
##### Principle of least action  

$$
   \text{Action: }S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{L\left( q,\dot{q},t \right) \,\,dt}
$$  
   
$$
   \text{Lagrange Equation: }\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\,\,=\text{0 }
$$
   
##### Galilean Relativity  
  
For a free particle in inertial frame, $$   L=L\left( v^2 \right) $$.  
  
Consider two inertial frames $$ K $$ and $$ {K}' $$  with relative velocity $$ {\boldsymbol{v}}' =\boldsymbol{v}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon }$$, the invariance of EOM only allows total derivative of a space-time dependent function. Differentiate against
