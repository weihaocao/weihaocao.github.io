##  Equation of Motion  
   
### Principle of least action  
  Definition:   
   $$
   \text{Action: }S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{L\left( q,\dot{q},t \right) \,\,dt}
   $$  
   
   
$$
   \text{Lagrange Equation: }\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\,\,=\text{0 }
$$
   
### Galilean Relativity  
$$
   L=L\left( v^2 \right) 
$$
