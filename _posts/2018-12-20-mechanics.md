##  Equation of Motion  
   
##### Principle of least action  

$$
   \text{Action: }S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{L\left( q,\dot{q},t \right) \,\,dt}
$$  
   
$$
   \text{Lagrange Equation: }\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\,\,=\text{0 }
$$  
Moreover, with the additional term $$ L'=L+\frac{d}{dt}f\left( q,t \right) $$ the action integral is unchanged.  
   
##### Galilean Relativity  
<br />
For a free particle in inertial frame, $$   L=L\left( v^2 \right) $$.  
Consider two inertial frames $$ K $$ and $$ {K}' $$  with relative velocity $$ {\boldsymbol{v}}' =\boldsymbol{v}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon }$$, the invariance of EOM only allows total derivative of a space-time dependent function. Taylor expansion regarding variable $$ {\boldsymbol{v}}'$$, we get
$$
L\left( \left( v+dv \right)^2 \right) =L\left( v^2 \right) +\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^2}\times \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{v}^2}{\partial \boldsymbol{v}}\cdot d\boldsymbol{v}\approx L\left( v^2 \right) +2\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^2}\boldsymbol{v}\cdot \boldsymbol{\epsilon }
$$
when $$\epsilon$$ is small.   
By assuming the derivative term of the form $$   \frac{d}{dt}(f(q,t)) $$, we may claim that the derivative $$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial v^2}$$ is independent of velocity, and thus the Lagrangian $$ L=\frac{m}{2}v^2$$.
