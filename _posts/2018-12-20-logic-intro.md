# Basic Logic Concepts  

1. Logic is the study of the methods and principles used to distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning.  

2. Proposition(命题): A statement typically asserted using a declarative sentence, and hence always either true or false(which may be unknown).  

3. Inference: A process by which one proposition is arrived at and affirmed on the basis of some other proposition or propositions.  

4. Argument(论证): Any group of propositions of which one is claimed to follow from the others, which are regarded as providing support or grounds for the truth of that one.

5. Conclusion: In any argument, the proposition to which the other propositions in the argument are claimed to give support, or for
which they are given as reasons.

6. Premises: In an argument, the propositions upon which inference is based; the propositions that are claimed to provide grounds or reasons for the conclusion.

EXAMPLE:   
A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  
—The Constitution of the United States, Amendment 2
SOLUTION:   
Premise: A well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state.
